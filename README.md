## Requirements

This project designed for "Git" you need "Git" installed in your machine.

**For Windows Users Only (Linux and Mac skip this section):**
If you're using Windows and want to use this script, you'll need to run it in a Bash environment. Follow these steps:

1.  **Open Git Bash:**

    - If you're in a Git project directory, you can right-click and choose "Open Git Bash here."
    - Alternatively, you can search for "Git Bash" in the Start Menu.

2.  **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**

    - Once you have Git Bash open, make sure you are in git project repository. If you are not you can use the `cd` command to move to your Git project repository. For example, if your project is located at `C:\Users\attila\Projects\your-repo`, you can navigate to it with the following command:

    bashCopy code
    `cd /c/Users/attila/Projects/your-repo`
    Replace the path with the actual path to your Git project directory.

## Installation

Get started by setting up the commit message generator and validator:

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    `git clone https://github.com/realattila/clean_git_commit_message`
2.  **Move to repository**
    `cd clean_git_commit_message`
3.  **Copy the scripts to your project's hooks directory:**
    `cp commit-msg your-repo/.git/hooks/ `
    `cp commit-msg-generator.sh your-repo/`
    **Or you can do it with simple copy paste.**
    Copy `commit-msg` in `.git/hook` directory
    Copy `commit-msg-generator.sh` in project directory (`./`)

4.  **Make the `commit-msg` script executable:(Only Linux users)**
    `chmod +x your-repo/.git/hooks/commit-msg`

## Usage

Make sure your Terminal location is in your git project repository (you can make sure with run `pwd` command).
With the commit message generator and validator in place, creating and validating commit messages is a breeze:

1. **Commit with a generated message:**
   `bash commit-msg-generator.sh`
   This command executes the `commit-msg-generator.sh` script and uses its output as your commit message.
2. **Automatic validation:**
   The `commit-msg` hook will trigger automatically during commits. It validates your commit message format based on the rules you've set in the `commit-msg-generator.sh` script. Incorrect messages will be rejected.

## Customization

The `commit-msg-generator.sh` script is highly customizable. Tailor it to your project's specific commit message conventions. Adjust rules and constraints, such as:

- Defining consistent prefixes for different types of commits (e.g., "‚≠ê feature:", "üõ†Ô∏è fix:", "üîÉ refactor:")
- Enforcing minimum and maximum message lengths
- Specifying patterns or regular expressions for commit message matching
- Customizing error messages for validation failures

Warning: if you change commit message structure you need to fix validation in `commit-msg` file too.

## Contributing
